### What is synesthesia?

Synesthesia is the blending of the senses. Some people taste sounds,
others associate letters with colors.

### What does this add-on do?

It changes the colors of characters on web pages.

### Where can I get it?

You can get it on the addon market!

### Does it work on all websites?

No. We are literally changing the CSS. Making sure that all websites look the
same as their originals with the exception of this added functionality depends
on how other people coded their websites.

### I like this, how can I help?

I don't know a lot of javascript or CSS for that matter, but if you are
comfortable with them you can try to:

* make it faster
* provide a nice gui for disabling websites or changing the styles
* do you know of a style that doesn't make me dizzy? just make the changes!
* fix so that it doesn't break major websites.
